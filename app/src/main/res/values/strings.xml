    <string name="UniBie"> <b>A Lovable place to Live\n\n</b>
        <br>Down to earth, pleasantly normal and laid back: a good description of many of the citys residents and of Bielefeld itself. It is precisely that mixture of a metropolitan atmosphere and almost village-like sociability that makes Bielefeld what it is: an especially lovable city to live in. \n\n</br>
        <br>With a population of over 330,000 (and constantly on the rise), Bielefeld is one of the 20 largest cities in Germany. Its residents particularly appreciate the high quality of life, the advantages of a strong economic location and the range of educational and scientific facilities. More than one billion euros has been invested by the State of North Rhine-Westphalia into Campus Bielefeld, shared between Bielefeld University and the University of Applied Sciences. This has resulted in one of the most modern facilities for education and research in Germany.\n\n</br>
        <br>Few cities are as green as Bielefeld, thanks to its location amid the Teutoburg Forest, numerous parks as well as green transport corridors, with 762 kilometres of footpaths traversing the city area. For more of a city buzz, visit Siegfried Platz – known affectionately to locals as "Siggi" – in Bielefeld West, as well as Kesselbrink and Boulevard.\n\n</br>

        <b>Bielefeld University: Overview\n\n</b>
        <br>The university is located in the west of Bielefeld next to the Teutoburg Forest. The main building, which houses all the faculties and institutes, as well as the large library, is a functional concrete structure, typical of the 1960s.\n\n</br>
        <br>Intercity trains running between Cologne/Bonn and Berlin stop regularly at Bielefeld, and the university can be accessed via city tram (Line 4) in about 10 minutes from the city center—or in about 15 minutes by car. The nearest airport, Paderborn/Lippstadt, is about 50 kilometres southeast of  Bielefeld.\n\n</br>



        <b>Internationalisation strategy\n\n</b>
        <br>Bielefeld University is an internationally successful institution with networks across the globe. Its hallmark is that the experience of internationalisation is firmly anchored in all areas of the University. Bielefeld University sees itself as a social space for reflection, characterised by international exchange and cultural openness.\n\n</br>
        <br>It sees internationalisation as a process of change that leads to an intensification and qualitative enhancement of the international relations both within and outside the University. This process affects not only research, teaching and study, but the entire institution and the ‘culture of togetherness’. Internationalisation at Bielefeld University lives from and with scholars and students cooperating internationally. It is characterised by personal interaction and open communication.\n\n</br>
        <br>In many research areas, Bielefeld University is a leading research institution which attracts researchers from abroad with its strong profile and relevance. Each year it welcomes to Bielefeld several hundred visiting scholars as well as students from the whole world. These include at-risk and refugee scholars, which the University supports as a member of the Scholars at Risk Network, as well as refugees who are wishing to study. Study programmes in English, Double Degree Programmes as well as study programmes with an international track prepare students from Germany and abroad for the international job market.\n\n</br>
        <br>Students thus acquire intercultural competence in an environment characterised by diversity. Apart from the internationalisation ‘abroad’, the internationalisation that takes place ‘at home’ also plays a significant role and is another facet of an integrated internationalisation strategy. For this reason, the University fosters international cooperation and partnerships with universities on all continents and participates in international research projects. Students are offered various opportunities to gain experience abroad.\n\n</br>
